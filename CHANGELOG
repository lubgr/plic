v.02

* API change: printf-format strings can be passed to the variadic template functions arbitrarily
  often. The format specifier are counted using a regex, if arguments are left, the recursive calls
  restart, beginning either with a new string literal (which can be a format strings, doesn't have
  to be) or with an arbitrary object with std::ostream << operator.
* Indicate meta information with a dedicated enum and then pass __FILE__, __LINE__ and __func__.
* Use CPPFLAGS, LIBS and LDFLAGS (environment or cmd-line specification) in the build process for
* an autotools-close behavior.
* Two exemplary configuration files distributed together with the source.
* Fix memory leak bugs, failing test cases for older python versions, minor fixes.
* Override the python SIGINT handler to prevent memory leaks.

v.01

* Basic setup of logging via streams and printf-like format strings with variable arguments.
  Configuration via python strings or streams, little documentation in a README.
