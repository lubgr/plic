- test class for pure .c logging

- check compilation issues with clang++ and update README that both compilers work

- also check older g++ versions

- work on test coverage

- add plic::setDefaultLogger(name) and then save typing when an application always uses the e.g.
  "eiw4" logger? then, a new set of functions must be there -- and also a new error source [calling
  these functions but no default logger is configured]

  void debug(const std::string& fmt, ...);
  ...

- PKGBUILD and makepkg.sh (only in the AUR? there should be a local one to install it for testing,
  the AUR one can still be an unstable plic-git package because plic isn't stable enough at this
  point?

- implement variadic template functions

- when merging to v0.2: CHANGELOG
